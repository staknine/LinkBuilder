# CSS and Styling

The admin dashboard and the example laning page, as well as the "app"-pages are
styled with Tailwind and Tailwind components from Daisy UI. Daisy UI are a bootstrap
component system that support light/dark-mode out of the box.

Daisy UI is of course optional but speeds up development a lot makes it really easy
to build a consistent UI.

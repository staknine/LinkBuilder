# Introduction

Get started and save a huge amount of time and resources by using the SAAS
start kit built with Phoenix and LiveView. With the SAAS Starter Kit for Phoenix
and LiveView, you can skip all of the grunt work and go right ahead to building your SAAS.

## Included Features

### Phoenix LiveView

Phoenix LiveView is the fastest way to build a performant realtime
application. Howver, even if Phoenix LiveView is included it is not
mandatory. You can still build your frontend, if any, with React, Vue or just plain HTML.

### Tailwind and Alpine

Tailwind and Alpine is included in the SAAS Starter Kit but can be
replaced with any other CSS or javascript framework. However, the included
back office/admin is build with Tailwind and Admin and the recommendation
is to keep it that way.

on the popular Pow authentication system.
